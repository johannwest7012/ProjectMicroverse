# ProjectMicroverse

Obscurly named ProjectMicroverse after I made a connection to from this idea to the Rick and Morty episode where he has a microverse inside a battery that powers his ship, this program is basically a scrape and post program. 

It utilizes an API call and python libraries to first collect data from Instagram based on certain requirements, which can be pictures or videos, then it stores these in a local directory that can be specified. \

Then, it reformats the posts so they can then be posted to another Instagram account. 

The final part is the scheduled posting of the items in the directory. Captions can be generated easily, pulling from either a collection of templated captions or creating a customized caption such as crediting the original poster of the account.
